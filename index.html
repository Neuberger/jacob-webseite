                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>At the tender age of one, I was already singing the melodies of children's songs to the members of my family.
                    The melodies of the nursery rhymes they had played to me on cassette and disc or vinyl record. To this day, I have easy access to new sound tools to inspire people.
                    
                    <br><br>My academic background includes studying music education in Stuttgart
                    Weilimdorf (2006-2008) and jazz studies at the conservatory in Enschede (2008- 2011).
                    Since then I have been working as a freelance solo artist, playing shows (TedX, TIFF etc.) and smaller festivals ("Nimmplatz Open
                    smaller festivals (‘Nimmplatz Open Air’, ‘NUR Live’ etc.), hold beatboxing and singing
                    workshops for disadvantaged &amp; autistic children and work as a private teacher.
                    
                    <br><br>In my live performances, I work in a wide variety of forms, also as an
                    instrumentalist together with others, but also alone on stage as a loop artist.
                    I do not allow myself to be restricted by predefined genre boundaries, my sound art is characterised by constant transitions and fusions, a reference to funk, reggae, pop and hip hop, soul, electro and rock.
                    hop, soul, electro and rock in all their forms right through to classical music and thus a
                    mirror of my lifelong musical socialisation.
                </p>
